# gg.ahk

A script to improve communication in LoL by removing all potentially ~~human~~ negative elements of it, and speaking in chat only with pre-meditated motivational one-liners.

### Setup
- download and install autohotkey
- download, extract the zip, and move the ggScript folder to your desired location
- gg.ahk MUST be in the same folder as the txt files for script to work properly. keep them all together
- edit the (top/bot/mid/jungle/general) compliments files with one-liners that congratulate them for good plays
- edit the cheerUpCharlie file with one-liners to help cheer up teammates when they are discouraged or starting to tilt
- double-click gg.ahk to start the script
- go play league (don't forget to test in a custome game)

###Usage
  First and foremost, you need to go into all the included text files, and review every single line to see if you are OK with saying these things in game. If you see something you would not want to say in-game, delete the entire line and add your own. You should be adding more phrases anyway, the only limit to how many one-liners can be in each file is your RAM.

  This script sets up fast keybindings to automatically chat to team mates. Note that hitting the space key will center the camera on your champ, so I would not try to use any of these bindings in the middle of a duel. Go test in a custom. 
- gg *space* will open chat and spit out a line of text from the generalCompliments.txt file,
- yy *space* spits from topCompliments.txt
- hh *space* spits from midCompliments.txt
- nn *space* spits from botCompliments.txt
- jj *space* spits from jungleCompliments.txt
- vv *space* spits from cheerupCharlies.txt

###Disclaimer
I created have enjoyed personal use of this script (gg.ahk) with no negative consequence so far, but I do not guarantee its fitness for use by others. I have not been banned for using gg.ahk, but you might get banned by riot for using this script, as Section V, Part J of the [http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse](League of Legends TOU) can be interpreted to prohibit chat scripts, especially if you use the script to spam the chat. You might get banned by riot for using the phrases already included in the script. This script might break in the middle of a game. This script might interfere with your keybindings in the middle of a teamfight and throw the game, losing you your promotion match to Diamond 1. *Test the script on your own in a custom to see if you are comfortable using it in competitive modes.*
