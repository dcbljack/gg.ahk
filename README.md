# gg.ahk

A script to improve communication in LoL by removing all potentially ~~human~~ negative elements of it, and speaking in chat only with pre-meditated motivational one-liners.

### Setup
- download and install autohotkey
- download this zip file wherever you want the final script
- gg.ahk MUST be in the same folder as the txt files for script to work properly. keep them all together
- edit the (top/bot/mid/jungle/general) compliments files with one-liners that congratulate them for good plays
- edit the cheerUpCharlie file with one-liners to help cheer up teammates when they are discouraged or starting to tilt
- double-click gg.ahk to start the script
- go play league (don't forget to test in a custome game)

###Usage
this script sets up fast keybindings to automatically chat to team mates, note that hitting the space key will center the camera on your champ, so I would not try to use any of these bindings in the middle of a duel. Go test in a custom. 
- gg *space* will spit out a line of text from the generalCompliments.txt file
- yy *space* spits from topCompliments.txt
- hh *space* spits from midCompliments.txt
- nn *space* spits from botCompliments.txt
- jj *space* spits from jungleCompliments.txt
- vv *space* spits from cheerupCharlies.txt

###Disclaimer
I created have enjoyed personal use of this script (gg.ahk) with no negative consequence so far, but I do not guarantee its fitness for use by others. You might get banned by riot for using this script. You might get banned for using the phrases already included in the script. This script might break. This script might interfere with your keybindings in the middle of a teamfight and throw the game, losing you your promotion match. *Test the script on your own in a custom to see if you are comfortable using it in competitive modes.*
